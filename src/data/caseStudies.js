    overview:
      'For the 47 Consultants Video Marketing Agency project, I designed a modern, user-friendly website in Figma, ensuring an intuitive layout and a visually engaging experience for visitors. I then developed the website in WordPress, implementing responsive design to ensure it looks great across all devices. The site was hosted on SiteGround, providing fast loading speeds and reliable uptime. Additionally, I configured Google Search Console (GSC) and performed initial SEO optimization to improve the website’s visibility and organic search performance. The result was a fully functional, professional website that effectively represents the brand and supports its marketing efforts.',
